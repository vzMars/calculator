## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This calculator can string together several operations correctly and only evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time. Can clear data from the screen and prevents the user from dividing by 0. Also handles floating point numbers correctly.

## Optimizations:

I would love to add keyboard support to this calculator and add a backspace button that lets the user undo it if they click the wrong number. I would also like to add a rounding feature and prevent any overflowing in the display screen. I would also like to create a display/UI class that controls all aspects related to what the user sees.

## Lessons Learned:

My first attempt at making this calculator wasn't using OOP. With this attempt, I was able to learn more about using OOP in a project which improved the readability and reduced the complexity of the calculator. I also learned how to use the class syntax that JavaScript provides.
